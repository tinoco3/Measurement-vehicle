### Remote Controller
- **Interactive LCD Display** showing:
  - Real-time distance measurements
  - Length/width calculations
  - Area computation
- **Dual-mode operation**:
  - Distance Mode: Tracks movement
  - Area Mode: Guides through length/width measurements
- **Wireless Control** via nRF24L01 module
- **Joystick Navigation** for precise vehicle movement

### Vehicle Unit
- **Precision Movement** with H-bridge motor control
- **Accurate Distance Tracking** using wheel encoders
- **Wireless Feedback** of measurement data
- **Debounced Interrupts** for reliable sensor readings

## Hardware Components

### Remote Controller
- Arduino Uno/Nano
- nRF24L01 RF Transceiver
- 16x2 LCD Display
- Analog Joystick
- Mode Selection Buttons

### Vehicle
- Arduino Uno/Nano
